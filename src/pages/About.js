        Recovering from an operation, Daniel Taylor needed a creative way to get
        his daily dose of 'cocktail shrooms' and he came up with a twist on the
        classic childhood cocktail, the Ketel One martini. In an effort to
        minimize the alcohol intake, he created a low-alcohol version of his
        favorite martini. As an added element, he added an element of psilocybin
        - the active ingredient in magic mushrooms. Ketel One Botanical, a
        specially crafted blend of Ketel One vodka, arnica and chamomile, is
        used to extract the magic from the fungus and infuse it into the drink.
